# ‚òÅÔ∏è Azure Web App Lab

## üìú Overview  
This project involved deploying a web application to Microsoft Azure, configuring it to run in the App Service environment, and ensuring that it is accessible and secure. The objective was to experience cloud deployment workflows (including setup, configuration, and deployment) and understand how to host a real web app in Azure.

## üß∞ Tools & Technologies  
- **Azure App Service** ‚Äì host and run the web app  
- **Azure Portal / Azure CLI** ‚Äì deploy, configure, manage resources     
- **Environment configuration** ‚Äì app settings, environment variables  

## üß™ What I Did  
- Created an Azure resource group and App Service plan  
- Deployed the web application to Azure App Service  
- Configured runtime settings, environment variables, and scaling  
- Verified the app was live via its public URL  
- (If applicable) Integrated a CI/CD pipeline to automate deployment from GitHub  
- Tested for availability and correct behavior post-deployment
