# ‚òÅÔ∏è Azure Web App Lab

## üìú Overview  
This project involved deploying a web application to Microsoft Azure, configuring it to run in the App Service environment, and ensuring that it is accessible and secure. The objective was to experience cloud deployment workflows (including setup, configuration, and deployment) and understand how to host a real web app in Azure.

## üß∞ Tools & Technologies  
- **Azure App Service** ‚Äì host and run the web app  
- **Azure Portal / Azure CLI** ‚Äì deploy, configure, manage resources     
- **Environment configuration** ‚Äì app settings, environment variables  

## üß™ What I Did  
- Created an Azure resource group and App Service plan  
- Deployed the web application to Azure App Service  
- Configured runtime settings, environment variables, and scaling  
- Verified the app was live via its public URL  
- (If applicable) Integrated a CI/CD pipeline to automate deployment from GitHub  
- Tested for availability and correct behavior post-deployment

## üß† What I Learned  
- How to deploy a web application to Azure using both the Portal and CLI  
- Managing Azure resources like App Service and Resource Groups  
- Configuring runtime environments, environment variables, and settings for cloud deployment  
- (If used) How CI/CD pipeline integration works for automated deployment  
- Considerations for cloud deployment: scaling, availability, and configuration

## ‚ö° Future Enhancements  
- Add HTTPS/SSL configuration and custom domain setup  
- Add monitoring and logging (Application Insights)  
- Add database backend or other services (e.g. Azure SQL, Cosmos DB)  
- Improve CI/CD pipeline (auto rollback, staging slots)  
- Optimize performance, caching, and security headers
