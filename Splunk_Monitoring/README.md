# ðŸ“Š Splunk Monitoring Project

## ðŸ“œ Overview
This project focused on designing and implementing a security monitoring solution using **Splunk**.  
I learned how to collect, analyze, and visualize log data to identify potential security incidents and trends.  
The goal was to simulate a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) workflow similar to what security analysts use in real-world environments.

## ðŸ§° Skills & Tools
- Splunk Enterprise
- Log ingestion and parsing
- Dashboard creation
- Search Processing Language (SPL)
- Basic security monitoring concepts

## ðŸ§ª What I Did
- Installed and configured Splunk for log ingestion  
- Collected and indexed system log data  
- Built interactive dashboards to visualize security events  
- Applied search queries to detect suspicious activity  
- Audited and analyzed user activity through log data
