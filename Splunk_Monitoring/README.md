# ðŸ“Š Splunk Monitoring Project

## ðŸ“œ Overview
This project focused on designing and implementing a security monitoring solution using **Splunk**.  
I learned how to collect, analyze, and visualize log data to identify potential security incidents and trends.  
The goal was to simulate a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) workflow similar to what security analysts use in real-world environments.

## ðŸ§° Skills & Tools
- Splunk Enterprise
- Log ingestion and parsing
- Dashboard creation
- Search Processing Language (SPL)
- Basic security monitoring concepts

## ðŸ§ª What I Did
- Installed and configured Splunk for CSV log ingestion  
- Collected and indexed system log data    
- Applied search queries to detect suspicious activity
  -  
- Audited and analyzed user activity through log data

- Collected CSV logs containing server speed test results.  Used **eval** to calculate a ratio to compare download to upload speeds and **table** to display in information in specific order.  This lead to the indication of a possilbe DoS attack.

- Created a count of critical serverity vulnerabiliites from the nessus_log.csv from a specific destination IP in order to know if we are vulnerable.

- Set up an alert for the critical vulnerabilities with the highest priority.

- Created an alert after establishing some baselines from a separate brute force attack.
